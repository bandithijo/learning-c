# 20 Introduction to Operators in C

`15 * 10` => Arithmetic operator

`300000000 >= 500000000` => Relational operator

`if (have_chair && have_table)` => Logical operator

## Types of operators in C

| Name of operators             | Operators                             |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Arithmetic operators          | `+ - * / %`                           |
| Increment/Decrement operators | `++ --`                               |
| Relational operators          | `== != <= >= < >`                     |
| Logical operators             | `&& \|\| ! `                          |
| Bitwise operators             | `&, ^, \|, ~, >>, <<`                 |
| Assignment operators          | `= += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= &= ^= \|= ` |
| Other operators               | `?: & * sizeof() ,`                   |
