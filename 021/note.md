# 21 Arithmetic Operators in C

| Symbol | Name           |
|--------|----------------|
| +      | Addition       |
| -      | Subtraction    |
| *      | Multiplication |
| /      | Division       |
| %      | Modulus        |

All are "binary operators" means 2 operands are required to perform operation.


## Operator Precedence and Associativity

| Precedence | Operators | Associativity |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Highest    | * / %     | Left to Right |
| Lowest     | + -       | Left to Right |

Note: Associativity is used only when two or more operators are of same precedence.

For example: `+ -` Same precedence therefore we use associativity
