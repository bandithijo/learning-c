# 14 Variable Modifiers âˆ’ Static

## Takeways

1. Static variable remains in memory even if it is declared within a block on the other hand automatic variable is destroyed after the completion of function in which it was declared.
2. Static variable if declared outside the scope of any function will act like global variable but only within the file in which it is declared.
3. You can only assign a constant literal (or value) to a static variable.
